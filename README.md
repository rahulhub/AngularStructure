# AngularStructure
I am going to create an base structure for all type of dynamic sites. It will have customizable components like header,navigation,pages , etc

Setup:
1. Install node.js and npm(Latest LTS Version: 14.17.0 currently): https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
2. If you want to uninstall previous angular cli version :
    npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
    npm cache clean --force
3. Install Angular cli
    Install Globally

    npm install -g @angular/cli

    Install Locally

    npm install @angular/cli

    To run a locally installed version of the angular-cli, you can call ng commands directly by adding the .bin folder within your local node_modules folder to your    PATH. The node_modules and .bin folders are created in the directory where npm install @angular/cli was run upon completion of the install command.
4. Create  new project using CLI
    ng new angular-structure
